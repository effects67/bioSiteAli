<h2 id="#hi">Hello!</h2> 

<p>  My name is Alicia Sanchez. I was born in Dallas, Texas in 1994 and have loved living here ever since. I live with my family and am the oldest child, with two sisters and one brother. I attend the University of North Texas and am currently majoring in accounting. When I'm not helping take care of my family or going to school, I work as a baby-sitter at a local church-run day care.
